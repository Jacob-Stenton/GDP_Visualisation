          <h2>What</h2>
          <p>
            This is a visualisation project focusing on annual gross domestic
            product (GDP), total energy consumption and the average household
            price of energy in the United Kingdom. The bulk of this project was
            completed using d3.js, which is a library used for creating data
            visualisations. Clicking on the link above will take you to a few
            graphs representing data linked to the previously mentioned topics.
            They offer a small, but important, analytical insight into the
            economic state of the UK.

          <h2>Why</h2>
          <p>
            It's important to examine these subjects closely as they help us
            understand our country's economic health. GDP reflects our overall
            economic activity, which then informs important policy descisions
            made by our government. Energy usage helps indicate industrial
            developement, as well as our sustainability. Energy prices impact
            inflation, cost of living, and industrial competitiveness, making it
            an important factor to monitor as it helps to ensure economic
            stability and social equity. These indicators collectively provide
            insights into the economy's performance, helping to build new ideas
            for efficient, fair and sustainable growth.

          <h2>Data</h2>
          <p>
            Three different data sets are used in this project. Each data set
            has a different range of dates, hinderng the range of data that can
            be used on some of the graphs.<br /><br />

        <h2>What</h2>
        <p>
          This is a visualisation project focusing on annual gross domestic
          product (GDP), total energy consumption and the average household
          price of energy in the United Kingdom. The bulk of this project was
          completed using d3.js, which is a library used for creating data
          visualisations. Clicking on the link above will take you to a few
          graphs representing data linked to the previously mentioned topics.
          They offer a small, but important, analytical insight into the
          economic state of the UK.

        <h2>Why</h2>
        <p>
          It's important to examine these subjects closely as they help us
          understand our country's economic health. GDP reflects our overall
          economic activity, which then informs important policy descisions
          made by our government. Energy usage helps indicate industrial
          developement, as well as our sustainability. Energy prices impact
          inflation, cost of living, and industrial competitiveness, making it
          an important factor to monitor as it helps to ensure economic
          stability and social equity. These indicators collectively provide
          insights into the economy's performance, helping to build new ideas
          for efficient, fair and sustainable growth.

        <h2>Data</h2>
        <p>
          Three different data sets are used in this project. Each data set
          has a different range of dates, hinderng the range of data that can
          be used on some of the graphs.<br /><br />
